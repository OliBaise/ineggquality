    <section class="intro">
      <p>With egg prices at an all-time high in the USA, we looked at salary data from the Federal Reserve of St Louis and egg price data from Numbeo to find out how long it takes to earn a 12 pack of eggs in 204 of the 210 Designated Market Areas in the USA.</p>

    <section class="key-findings">
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Laredo, Texas have the least affordable eggs in the USA, with the average person having to work for 17 minutes and 20 seconds to pay for a 12 pack of eggs.</li>
        <li>Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo, California have the most affordable eggs in the USA, with people only having to work for 7 minutes and 50 seconds to buy a 12 pack of eggs.</li>
        <li>Eggs are 86.6% more affordable in Santa Barbara, California than they are in Laredo, Texas, the most and least affordable areas for eggs.</li>
        <li>On average, people in the USA need to work for 10 minutes and 58 seconds to pay for a twelve pack of eggs. That's more than double what that same figure was 5 years ago where Americans needed to work 4 minutes 59 seconds to buy a 12 pack of eggs.
      </ul>

        <p>Veronica Fletcher, recipe developer who founded the recipe website Pantry & Larder said:</p>
        <p>“Eggs are a low calorie source of protein and are very versatile in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>If you consume a lot of eggs and are finding that rising egg prices are causing financial strain, then here are some more affordable alternatives:</p>
   

      <div class="alternatives">
        <h3>Low Calorie High Protein Breakfast</h3>
        <p>Beans cooked in tomato sauce has been a staple high protein breakfast in countries as diverse as the UK, Mexico, Turkey and Morocco. A typical serving of kidney beans contains 20 grams of protein, which is the same as three eggs. Although you cannot cook beans as quickly as you can eggs, I like to make a big batch of slow cooked beans in tomato sauce and then heat up individual portions as an easy, high protein breakfast.</p>

        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <p>There are a few foods that you can replace eggs with when you’re baking. It depends on the texture you want to get with your final product. For more dense cakes like pancakes and cookies, overripe bananas are a great option. Replace each egg with one very ripe banana. For more fluffy cakes, combine one teaspoon of baking soda with one tablespoon of vinegar. This will help a cake rise during baking, which is the role that eggs play.</p>

        <h3>Healthy Fats</h3>
        <p>Egg yolks have been one of the cheapest means of getting omega 3 fatty acids in your diet. A couple of options to get this in your diet are avocados and canned fish. Both of these are relatively inexpensive.</p>

        <h3>Binding Agent</h3>
        <p>Eggs are often used as “food glue” when you want something to keep its shape instead of falling apart as you cook it. An example of this would be if you’re making homemade meatballs or burgers. With meat you can just use an extra pinch of salt. Salt will make some of the proteins in the meat dissolve into a gel when you cook it and this will bind the meat together. Non meat dishes are harder to replicate, but your best option is to use aquafaba (the thick water that tins of chickpeas come in). Aquafaba is also a vegan option.</p>

        <h3>Spreads and Dips</h3>
        <p>Increasing egg prices may also impact the cost of creamy spreads and dips like mayonnaise and ranch dressing as these often contain egg yolks. The best substitute for these is high fat yoghurt which you can then season with salt pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and mixed herbs.”</p>

    <section class="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>In order to determine the affordability of eggs across the USA, Eggquality started with a seed list of 210 Designated Market Areas (DMA) in the USA.</p>
      <p>We then ran these through the Federal Reserve of St Louis to find each area’s median income (figures were correct as of February 2025). When a DMA’s median salary was not listed in the Federal Reserve of St Louis we used salary data from the nearest city to that DMA that had up to date median salary data in its database.</p>
      <p>We then looked up egg prices for each DMA on Numbeo, the following DMA’s did not have egg prices on Numbeo so were excluded from this study: <em>Clarksburg-Weston, WV; Glendive, MT; Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville, TX; Meridian, MS; North Platte, NE; Salisbury, MD.</em></p>
      <p>We then used the following formula to calculate how long it took to earn a 12 pack of eggs based on each DMA’s median salary:</p>
      <p><i>(egg price / (median hourly income / 60)) * 60</i></p>
      <p>This gave us the number of seconds it took to pay for a twelve pack of eggs, and we then converted this into minutes and seconds by dividing the number by 60.</p>
<p>We found out how many minutes it took to earn a 12 pack of egggs by looking at average egg prices and average hourly earnings in the USA in April 202 from the Federal Bank of St Louis.</p>
